SnipEx Release 1.0

This package contains the server components for SnipEx. Its made up of two CFC's: Application.cfc and SnipEx.cfc.

You can define the settings you require in Application.cfc and change the behaviour of your SnipEx server in the SnipEx.cfc

Once you have installed the datbase using the snipex.sql file (this is for mySQL but you can easily modify it to support any database) you need to create an entry in the lib table for your initial library.

This library will contain the name of your SnipEx server and is used as the 'root' node.
